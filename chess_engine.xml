        Welcome to single-player chess!


        Notes:

        -- You play as white. The computer plays as black.

        -- To capture a piece:
        ---- 1. Move the opponent's piece off the board.
        ---- 2. Place your piece on its new square.

        -- Pawns automatically promote to queens.

        -- To castle, simply move your king to its new square. The rook will automatically be moved for you.

        -- This is king-capture chess, meaning that players are allowed to play a move that ends with their own king in check, and the king can be captured.

        -- The computer may take some time to think about its move.

        -- The chess engine is not that robust. The following things may break the game:
        ---- Tossing a piece or letting a piece roll across the board.
        ---- Going back in the game's history using the left and right arrows at the top of the screen.
        ---- Randomly moving black's pieces around the board.
